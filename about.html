            Claudia Borfiga is a visual artist, born in Greater London, she currently resides in Sheffield, after spending eight years living in California and Colorado. She graduated with a BFA (Hons) in Textiles Design from Loughborough University, a place where she first honed her screen printing and dyeing skills. Her joy for the outdoors world is evident in the work she makes, leaning into dreamscapes through her use of colour and texture. Her ideas are sparked from regular hikes that help unfurl her mind. Curious about process, she works across tactile mediums that engage her hands, including paper, textiles, print and ceramics. She has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in Europe and the United States, as well as taught many workshops and attended artist residencies.
